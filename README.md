NeuroSim
========

A simple neuron simulator using numpy and matplotlib.
Can simulate multi-compartment neurons with soma, dendrites and axon. 
Implements Hodgkin-Huxley equations, Rall's cable theory and several synapse models. 
Visualizes the potentials in a matplotlib graph and allows direct user interaction (e. g. insert current, show segment parameters).
